# Social segregation and differentiation in higher education: a British case study with population data

Sociologists highlight the importance of institutional stratification in reproducing economic and social inequalities through higher education (HE). To a greater or lesser extent, across HE systems, institutions vary in status and income, differentiating the student experience and generating varying amounts of symbolic capital for their graduates. Research in the sociology of education has, however, tended only to quantify segregation in compulsory schooling. Building upon Croxford and Raffe's (2013) research, our study investigates differentiation and social segregation, taking  HE institutions in the informally stratified UK system as a case. We analyse data from the Higher Education Statistical Agency (HESA) for all UK-domiciled first-degree graduates between 2010/11 and 2020/21. Using the social segregation indices (Massey et al., 1996), we examine the distribution of first-degree graduates in UK HE institutions by sex, ethnicity, disability, nationality and age. 

I am currently managing all the coding related to the segregation paper within this repository. Specifically, I am working on the R code to study the dataset in the data analysis markdown file, and I am organising the main findings of the data analysis in the paper markdown.
